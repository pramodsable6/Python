- Everything is an object in Python e.g. int, float, str are classes under the hood <br/>
- This can be confirmed using.
```python
type(5)
```
o/p:
```
<class 'int'>
```
- 'class' keyword allows you to define your own classes. Which can have its own attributes and methods.
- Classes are useful since different people can work on different part(class) of the project and then all the parts can be combined later.

- 4 pillars of OOP
  - Encapsulation: all the attributes and methods of a class are packaged in a blueprint
  - Abstraction: class methods and attributes can be accessed without worrying about how they are implemented.
    Public and Private types are used to hide away information and give access to only what we want to.
  - Inheritance: child - parent relationship is possible. Child classes inherit the properties of parent class.
  - Polymorphism: method and operator overloading and overriding
