- Arithmetic progression - add a diff
  - Common diff - d
  - Sum of n terms formula --> n/2 [2a + (n â€“ 1)d]
  - nth term = a + (n - 1) * d

- Geometric progression - multiply by a no. or fraction
  - Common ratio - r
  - Sum of n terms formula --> (a(r^n - 1)) / (r - 1)
  - nth term = a*r^(n - 1)
