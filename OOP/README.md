- Everything is an object in Python e.g. int, float, str are classes under the hood <br/>
- This can be confirmed using.
```python
type(5)
```
o/p:
```
<class 'int'>
```
- 'class' keyword allows you to define your own classes. Which can have its own attributes and methods.
- Classes are useful since different people can work on different part(class) of the project and then all the parts can be combined later.
